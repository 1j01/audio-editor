# [![](images/icon-32.png) Audio Editor][app]

[This is the audio editor of the future.][app]


### Features

* Drag and drop audio files
* Always saved locally
* Persistent undo/redo and selection
* Several themes, including light and dark [elementary OS][] themes via [elementary.css][], and some retro themes


### Future Features

Note how the bar with beat markings is a track. It would become a metronome when unmuted.

Tracks can be pinned to the top,
which should easy the pain when you have many tracks with audio clips
you want to line up with some main audio track(s).
**Currently this breaks pasting, among other things.**

You will be able to "precord" up to five minutes or as long as precording has been enabled. 

MIDI is a distinct possibility but certainly not a priority.

Embedding. Plugins. Desktop apps.

Internationalization with translations and LTR UI.
[RTLCSS][] can help with UI mirroring,
but I'd have to update the code for tracks.
I don't know how much mirroring would be appreciated, but I think it would be kinda fun.


### TODO

* Effects
* Horizontal scrolling and zooming
