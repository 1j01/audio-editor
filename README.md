This is just a [mockup](http://1j01.github.io/audio-editor/) at the moment.

Themes:
* [retro](http://1j01.github.io/audio-editor/#theme=retro)
* [paper](http://1j01.github.io/audio-editor/#theme=paper)
* [elementary](http://1j01.github.io/audio-editor/#theme=elementary)
* [elementary-dark](http://1j01.github.io/audio-editor/#theme=elementary-dark)

Note how the bar with beat markings is a track. It would become a metronome when unmuted.
