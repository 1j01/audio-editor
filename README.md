[Wavey][app] is a simple web-based digital audio workstation (DAW), **currently in alpha**.

### Features

* Drag and drop audio files or record from a microphone.\* \*\*
* Always saved locally, including persistent undo/redo with the selection state; saves *while* you're recording\*\*
* Plays while recording so you can record along with previous tracks
* Lets you edit while playing or recording; you can even delete the recording while recording and undo to keep recording
* Several themes, including light and dark [elementary OS][] themes via [elementary.css][], and some retro themes
* Fully scalable graphics, from the icons to the waveforms
* Export the document or a selected range as WAV or MP3
* Can work completely offline, with [sw-precache][]

\*Audio recording quality may or may not match native applications in a given browser.
Record redundantly with another application if it matters to you.

\*\*There's a bug right now where **chunks are lost when recording!**
Dropped chunks will become skips (as opposed to gaps),
and the data written to the timeline will start to fall further behind the position indicator.
If you try to record something in time with something already recorded,
the skips will cause it to be shifted earlier in time and get out of sync.


### Future Features

* Note how the bar with beat markings is a track. It would become a metronome when unmuted.
It's a simplification of the concepts over DAWs which traditionally have a separate metronome.
There will still need to be a way to specify the BPM, and
it would also be good to have BPM detection and
variable BPM support (hopefully tying into a general automation system).
One idea I've had is, you could keep the beat with a foot pedal or something,
recorded along with a track.

* Tracks can be pinned to the top,
which should ease the pain when you have many tracks with audio clips
you want to line up with some main audio track(s).
(This partially implemented, but currently pinned tracks don't actually stay at the top when scrolling down.)

* You will be able to "precord" up to five minutes as long as precording has been enabled.
Choose whether to record something after the fact,
with the caveat(s) that you have to have it enabled and your mic(s) set up beforehand.
(Sadly it's not actually time travel.)
	* [Precorder][] is a separate project to do a similar thing
	on a device like a Raspberry Pi,
	the idea being you could have it always running,
	minimizing setup time and effort for recording.

* Projects should be able to contain separate, distinct timelines;
some DAWs have "takes", maybe something like that is what I want.
Ableton Live does something fairly reasonable.

* Nonlinear undo.
If you hit undo a bunch, then do something, normally the data is instantly lost.
If you try to redo, it doesn't do anything.
Instead, it should pop up with a tree view of the history.

* Soloing tracks? I wonder if something better could be done in this area.
Some more general system for configuring the set of tracks to play?
I don't know, but it's something to think about.

* MIDI: I'm thinking of having a collapsed overview of a MIDI clip,
and an expanded view to edit the notes, but still inline in the track.
(I've made a basic collapsed notes view component but haven't made a way to actually create it in the editor,
i.e. no way to record/import/create MIDI data.)

* Effects! I'm holding off on adding gain and panning because
I think if the effects UI is good enough, they should be able to simply be effects,
and I don't want to just immitate the status quo UI and end up with something that's "good enough" but not as good as it could be.
Gain/panning may warrant special treatment such as being added by default to the effects chain,
but they probably shouldn't be separate from it.
After all you'll want to be able to automate them just the same.

* Plugins
(e.g. instrument interfaces like
[tri-chromatic-keyboard](https://github.com/1j01/tri-chromatic-keyboard) or
[guitar](https://github.com/1j01/guitar),
effects,
synthesizers (voices),
algorithmic synthesis like [HTML5 Bytebeat](http://greggman.com/downloads/examples/html5bytebeat/html5bytebeat.html),
themes,
extra file formats)

* Desktop app, *ideally native* rather than web-based (but web-based for starters)

* Interoperability with Audacity? (exporting/importing project files)

* Whatever replaces Web Intents, probably the [Web Share API](https://github.com/WICG/web-share) and [Web Share Target API](https://github.com/WICG/web-share-target)

* Internationalization


### TODO

* Document loading indicator
* Fix losing chunks when recording
* Decouple the rendering rate of recorded audio from the size of chunks saved
(maybe even have a tiered saving system where chunks are merged to improve load times)
* Fix pasting across non-consecutive tracks
* Maybe make the mute buttons clearer by making the iconography (not not) not negative;
would it be awkward to still call them mute buttons or have the hover text say mute/unmute?
* Mouse-relative zooming (preferably performant and smoothly animated)
* Storage management (handle running out of storage, handle multiple editors loaded for the same document, allow data purging, estimate max recording time)
* Improve accessibility
