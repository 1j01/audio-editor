# [![](images/icon-32.png) Audio Editor][app]

[This is the audio editor of the future.][app]


### Features

* Drag and drop audio files or record from a microphone
* Always saved locally, including persistent undo/redo and selection
* Several themes, including light and dark [elementary OS][] themes via [elementary.css][], and some retro themes
* Fully scalable graphics, from the icons to the waveforms
* Export the document or a selected range as WAV or MP3


### Future Features

Note how the bar with beat markings is a track. It would become a metronome when unmuted.

Tracks can be pinned to the top,
which should easy the pain when you have many tracks with audio clips
you want to line up with some main audio track(s).
**Currently this breaks pasting, among other things.**

You will be able to "precord" up to five minutes or as long as precording has been enabled. 

MIDI is a possibility.

Embedding. Plugins. Desktop apps.

Internationalization and improved accessibility.


### TODO

* Finish up horizontal scrolling
* Mouse-relative zooming (also preferably performant zooming)
* Effects
* Gain control and panning (maybe as effects? depends on what the effects UI will look like)
* Application Cache, because this app can work completely offline
